# Jvav1
Jvav1 is a programming language designed to be fully compatible with Java syntax. It adheres strictly to the Java 8 language specification, ensuring seamless integration with existing Java environments. Jvav1 source files utilize the .jvav file extension. During the compilation process, these files are first translated into standard .java files, which are subsequently processed by the Java Compiler (javac).
While Jvav1 maintains complete syntactic compatibility with Java 8, it introduces an innovative feature: support for Chinese characters. This allows developers to write code using Chinese equivalents for standard Java constructs, thereby enhancing the accessibility and usability of the language for Chinese-speaking developers. However, it is important to note that Jvav1 is intended for educational and experimental purposes only. It is not recommended for use in production environments, as this may lead to unpredictable results and potential issues.
